Apply functional programming approach to solve this problem.

You have a list of students

var Students = [
{
	name:'Student1'
	marks: 70,
	subject: 'English'
},
{
	name:'Student1'
	marks: 55,
	subject: 'Math'	

},
{
	name:'Student1'
	marks: 40,
	subject: 'English'
},
{
	name:'Student1'
	marks: 30,
	subject: 'Computers'
},
{
	name:'Student1'
	marks: 90,
	subject: 'Physics'
},
];

Now, I would like to 
1. find all students who have got more than 40 marks
2. find all students who have choosen English as subject
3. find all students who have choosen either Computers or subject or scored more than 50.
